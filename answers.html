                    What is the difference between var, let and const?

                <div class="collapse-content">
                    <p>The var is the oldest keyword to declare a variable in JavaScript.
                        <br>
                        Scope: Global scoped or function scoped. The scope of the var keyword is the global or function
                        scope. It means variables defined outside the function can be accessed globally, and variables
                        defined inside a particular function can be accessed within the function.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The let keyword is an improved version of the var keyword.
                        <br>
                        Scope: block scoped: The scope of a let variable is only block scoped. It can't be accessible
                        outside the particular block ({block}). Let's see the below example.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The const keyword has all the properties that are the same as the let keyword, except the user
                        cannot update it.
                        <br>
                        Scope: block scoped: When users declare a const variable, they need to initialize it, otherwise,
                        it returns an error. The user cannot update the const variable once it is declared.

                    What is the difference between function and arrow function?
                </div>
                <div class="collapse-content">
                    <p>Inside of a regular JavaScript function, <em>this</em> value (aka the execution context) is
                        dynamic.
                        <br>
                        During a simple invocation the value of <em>this</em> equals to the global object (or undefined
                        if the
                        function runs in strict mode).
                        <br>
                        The behavior of <em>this</em> inside of an arrow function differs considerably from the regular
                        function's this behavior. The arrow function doesn't define its own execution context.
                        <br>
                        No matter how or where being executed, <em>this</em> value inside of an arrow function always
                        equals <em>this</em> value from the outer function. In other words, the arrow function resolves
                        this lexically.
                        <br>
                        The regular function can easily construct objects.
                        <br>
                        A consequence of <em>this</em> resolved lexically is that an arrow function cannot be used as a
                        constructor.
                        <br>
                        Inside the body of a regular function, arguments is a special array-like object containing the
                        list of arguments with which the function has been invoked.
                        <br>
                        On the other side, no arguments special keyword is defined inside an arrow function.
                        <br>
                        <em>return expression</em> statement returns the result from a function.
                        If the return statement is missing, or there's no expression after return statement, the regular
                        function implicitely returns undefined
                        <br>
                        I can return values from the arrow function the same way as from a regular function, but with
                        one useful exception.
                        <br>
                        If the arrow function contains one expression, and you omit the function's curly braces, then
                        the expression is implicitly returned. These are the inline arrows function.
                        <br>
                        The regular functions are the usual way to define methods on classes.
                        <br>
                        I can use the arrow function as methods inside classes.

                    What is the difference between map foreach filter and find?
                </div>
                <div class="collapse-content">
                    <p>The main difference between this two methods is that <em>forEach</em> allows you to change
                        elements of original array and returns undefined and <em>map</em> does not allow you to change
                        original array and intended for making new array based on original one.
                        <br>
                        The <em>find()</em> method returns the first value that matches from the collection. Once it
                        matches the value in findings, it will not check the remaining values in the array collection.
                        The <em>filter()</em> method returns the matched values in an array from the collection.
                    </p>

                    Why do we use template string?
                </div>
                <div class="collapse-content">
                    <p>Template strings are a powerful feature of modern JavaScript released in ES6. It lets us
                        insert/interpolate variables and expressions into strings without needing to concatenate like in
                        older versions of JavaScript. It allows us to create strings that are complex and contain
                        dynamic elements.</p>
